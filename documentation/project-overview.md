# Project Overview

## What this project is

A Silent Echo is a narrative-first survival game prototype inspired by the pacing model of *A Dark Room*:
- start with one essential action,
- apply pressure through resource decay,
- unlock new systems only after survival is established,
- use logs and environmental detail to reveal story.

## Product goals

- Deliver a readable terminal-style interface in a modern browser.
- Keep the interaction loop minimal and legible.
- Build tension through mechanics (cold, heat, risk) rather than jump scares.
- Expand into a data-driven game architecture where content can grow without major code rewrites.

## Scope of the current build

The current playable demo covers the opening survival sequence only:
1. Wake and boot flow.
2. Manual reactor stoking under cold pressure.
3. Gradual environmental awareness through repeated actions.
4. Wrist-band pickup that reveals vitals.
5. Doorway unlock and demo endpoint.

## Roadmap direction

The design spec in `documentation/game-spec.md` defines the intended expansion:
- day/night time budgeting,
- room graph exploration,
- inventory/crafting,
- weighted events,
- AI state progression,
- automation and macro systems,
- corruption/convergence narrative layers.

## Audience

- Players who enjoy low-UI, text-forward, systems-driven games.
- Contributors interested in game loops, procedural narrative variation, and atmospheric web UX.
